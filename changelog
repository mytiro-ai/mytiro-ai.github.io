### Changes Requested:
- Offset of the Hero SVG to the Right ✅

- Gap Between Benefits and Privacy Section ✅
- Green Component is being cut-off at the bottom ❓

OBERVATIONS:
- For the Green Component, I don't think there;s any way the entire green png can be seen in all display sizes.
    The Width is 100% and display is set to cover; which will cover the entire size of the component
    However, the Full PNG is seen in smaller displays
